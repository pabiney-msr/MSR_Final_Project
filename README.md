# MSR_Final_Project
# Project Description
The student worked with Dr. Jarvis Shultz and Prof. Nick Marchuk to reverse engineer a 3-D printer and reimplement the various printer components with an FPGA selected by the student.
 
# Needed Expertise
Forward and inverse kinematics, programming (Verilog), material selection and procurement, mechatronics.
 
# Responsibilities
The student will work with Prof. Marchuk during the spring and fall of 2017. The student will be responsible for designing any needed parts, selecting and ordering needed materials, and implementing the final design. The student will also develop the end user interface application. The student will work together with Prof. Marchuk to overcome any hurdles like material selection, PCB and part design, programming, etc.
